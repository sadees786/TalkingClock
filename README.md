# TalkingClock
clocks that present the current time in a more "Human Friendly" way


1) Implemented Rule Engine dessign pattern.
2) Implemented a separate class Library  "TalkingClockRuleEngine" to implement the conversion of digital time to a Human-Friendly format.
3)  Added the class library in both console application and Rest API.
